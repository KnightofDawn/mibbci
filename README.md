Recommended preparation flow for recording with gUSBamp:

1. Attach the electrodes to the cap (An example of electrode setup for recording motor imagery: FC3, FCz, FC4, C5, C3, C1, Cz, C2, C4, C6, CP5, CPz, CP6, P3, Pz, P4)
2. Plug the electrode wires in the SAHARAbox
3. Connect the SAHARAbox to the gUSBamp
4. Connect the gUSBamp to your computer
5. Plug the gUSBamp into a power supply
6. Put on the electrode cap
7. Put the reference electrode on the left mastoid
8. Put the ground electrode on the right mastoid
9. Turn on the SAHARAbox
10. Turn on the gUSBamp
11. Link the amplifier with the gUSBamp client (gUSBamp.exe)
12. Perform the experiments
13. Turn off everything, especially the SAHARAbox as it runs on a battery
